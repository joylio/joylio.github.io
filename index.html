	<h4>Hey there <img width="40px" height="40px" src="/images/smile.png" alt=":)"> <h4>

	<h4>I am Jiayu, a <b>Game Engineer</b> with 1-year experience, currently pursuing my Master of Science degree in
	<a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/camd/gamedesign/academic-programs/game-science-design/" target="_blank" class="highlight">Game Science and Design</a> program
	at Northeastern University in Boston, MA.</h4>

	<h4>As a keen experimentist, I have constantly buried myself in <a href="/portfolio" class="highlight">building stuff</a>, where emerging tech has become my favorite -- Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSIPNhOiMoE" target="_blank" class="reference">Internet of Things</a> and haptics for gaming. I enjoy so much in innovating and crafting things with beautiful <a href="http://github.com/joylio" target="_blank" class="highlight">codes</a>. Apart from the geeky me, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/joylio" target="_blank" class="highlight">music</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEarfNgKKAA&feature=share" target="_blank" class="highlight">dance</a> are where I get most inspired. This magic constantly keeps me refreshed and uplifted.</h4>

	<h4>If you are interested in my experience and works, feel free to take a look at my <a href="/resume" class="highlight">resume</a> or simply <a href="/contact" class="highlight">drop me a line</a>. </h4>
