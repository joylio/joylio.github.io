	<h4>Hey there <img width="40px" height="40px" src="/images/smile.png" alt=":)"> <h4>

	<h4>I am Jiayu, a <b>Software and Game Engineer</b>, currently pursuing my Master of Science degree in
	<a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/camd/gamedesign/academic-programs/game-science-design/" target="_blank" class="highlight">Game Science and Design</a> program
	at Northeastern University in Boston.</h4>

	<h4>As a keen experimentist, I constantly bury myself in <a href="/portfolio" class="highlight">building stuff</a>, creating well-structured <a href="http://github.com/joylio" target="_blank" class="highlight">codes</a> and highly-encapsulated libraries/APIs. Except for general software engineering, I have experience in 2D/3D graphics programming, VR, AR, Arduino and sensors for gaming. </h4>

	<h4>Apart from the geeky side, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/joylio" target="_blank" class="highlight">music</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEarfNgKKAA&feature=share" target="_blank" class="highlight">dance</a> are where I get most inspired. This magic constantly keeps me refreshed and uplifted. If you are interested in my experience and works, feel free to take a look at my <a href="/resume" class="highlight">resume</a> or simply <a href="/contact" class="highlight">drop me a line</a>. </h4>
