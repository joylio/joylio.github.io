#### __Project Description__

#### Mad Science is a 2D single-player educational game created using Unity engine and JSON.NET for Unity. The core gameplay mechanics feature a script-driven system and user-defined content mods. A more detailed project introduction can be found [here](http://www.northeastern.edu/madscience/){:target="_blank"}.

#### I am currently working on this project as one of the two programmers in a team of five. My contributions to the current version of the game include but are not limited to:

#### 1. Built gameplay and UI functionalities

#### 2. Designed, prototyped and developed character creating tool and multi-world auto-generating tools such as poster generating system using user-defined scripts across scenes in runtime

#### 3. Established online court experiment scenarios, which were published as sub-project of MadScience and used by a local court

#### 4. Designed and performed test cases, created JSON files to identify and fix bug issues
