#### __Project Description__

#### The original idea of this game was inspired by the song [_Sound of Silence_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zLfCnGVeL4){:target="_blank"}.

#### Premise: Originally the idea was for the various areas to serve as platforms for the player to experience both the current narrative but also the backstory which leads to its creation. Additionally, the mechanics for progression in this game were originally going to be puzzle and narrative based. In the sense that the player would have to talk to various NPC’s and solve puzzles to gain access to new areas. However, the current manifestation of the game revolves around a combat system utilizing a flute. Two actions are possible currently, attack and “blow” which causes an area of effect blow in a cone shape in front of the player. One could potentially envision a game space where both of these modes are combined to create more varied gameplay possibilities. In this version of the game, the gameplay resembles that of many “choice and consequence” RPG’s such as the Witcher series, where the player is given a number of options to deal with a situation. For the aggressive player, killing every NPC/Enemy may be a path to victory in the end. However, a more cautious player may choose to attempt to circumvent combat by completing a task for an NPC or subverting them in some way. In each level we detail how these various possibilities could become reality.

#### My contributions to the team project include but not limited to:

#### 1. Blueprint coding: AI NPC functionalities used in Level 2, where the AI needs to act on spotting the player character

#### 2. The design and implementation of gameplay in Level 1 where the story starts in the house
