#### __Project Description__

#### This is a survival-theme tabletop game, in some ways like [_The Settlers of Catan_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPhX_1RiwEg). The game contains a board(island) consisting of pieces of materials to be discovered The prototype was iterated from 6 rounds of playtests with different sets of statistics.

#### My contributions to the team project are:

#### 1. Game mechanics of the disaster types and related statistics proposal

#### 2. Board gameplay: Game starts with the pieces upside down, which players take rounds to discover the whole board

#### 3. First draft of the design documents
