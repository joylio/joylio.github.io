#### __Project Description__

#### The game is a runner game where the player controls the running cube's color trying to match the color with the incoming cubes'. The game includes a level editor for players to adjust the following parameters resulting in more interesting and challenging gameplay:

#### - The frequency of certain color in a given set of timeframes, e.g. some colors are rarer to be seen than others.

#### - The frequency of cubes appearing in a given set of timeframes.

#### - The speed of the main camera.

#### - Trigger point attached to each cube to make the color change take effect, i.e. the closer to the cube, the harder the gameplay would be.
