#### __Project Description__

#### The game is basically a runner game, where the frequency of appearance and colors of barricades (cubes) can be predefined by players in the inspector, and players are able to change the running Cube A\'s color with controls. The game over scenario would be that Cube A running into another cube with a different color, so players need to constantly change Cube A\'s color to match with the color of the cubes that it is about to hit.

#### The game includes a level editor in the Inspector area for players to adjust the gameplay difficulties in the following aspects:

#### - The frequency of certain color in a given set of timeframes, e.g. some colors are rarer to be seen than others.

#### - The frequency of cubes appearing in a given set of timeframes.

#### - The speed of the main camera.

#### - Trigger point attached to each cube to make the color change take effect, i.e. the closer to the cube, the harder the gameplay would be.
