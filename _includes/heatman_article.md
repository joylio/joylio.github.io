#### __Project Description__

#### The origin of Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival is about the [_Chang'e (嫦娥) becoming the Moon Goddess_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang%27e){:target="_blank"}, where I took a tiny part of the story, which is the bad guy Peng Meng breaking into the house looking for the valuable elixir, to make the level/game. In this game, players would play as Chang'e to hide from Peng Meng, as well as to beat him to the elixir.

#### My work for this game includes all the design and implementations (since it was an individual project):

#### 1. The design of game mechanics and stealth gameplay

#### 2. Modeling for the house, bookcase and other objects using Maya

#### 3. Coding for the behaviors of the AI NPCs using Unreal Blueprints
