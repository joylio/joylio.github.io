#### __Project Description__

#### This project is virtual-reality (VR) game created using Google Cardboard APIs and Unity3D. The core gameplay is a player-controlled leaf flying through an apocalyptic world while avoiding AI enemies. A unique mechanic applied in this game is using audio-input to drive the gameplay.

#### * The design of the core mechanics, such as audio as input, AI enemies
