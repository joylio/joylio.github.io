#### __Project Description__

#### This project is a Virtual Reality game created using Google Cardboard SDK and Unity3D. The core gameplay is a player-controlled leaf flying through an apocalyptic world while avoiding AI enemies and getting help from other smart agents. A unique mechanic applied in this game is using audio-input to drive the gameplay.

#### __Language__: C\#

#### __Platforms and Tools__: Unity 5, Google Cardboard API

#### __Download__: [Source Code](https://github.com/joylio/Leafly){:target="_blank"}

#### __Team Development Time__: 2 Weeks (with a narrative designer and an animator/associate programmer)

#### __Contributions__:

#### 1. The design of the core mechanics, such as using audio as an unconventional input measure, and AI enemy behaviors, etc.

#### 2. Built the module that converts audio input to multiple levels of controls, which is also friendly with graphics framerate.

#### 3. Worked on the camera angle and physics interactions to provide a realistic experience of moving and control, while maintaining a reasonable frame rate around 25 fps.

#### 4. Designed test cases and organized playtest sessions.
