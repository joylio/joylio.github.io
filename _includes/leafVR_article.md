#### __Project Description__

#### This project is a Virtual Reality game created using Google Cardboard API and Unity3D, and tested on Android phone. The core gameplay is a player-controlled leaf flying through an apocalyptic world while avoiding AI enemies. A unique mechanic applied in this game is using audio-input to drive the gameplay.

#### This game was started in the _Game Design and Analysis_ course with the other teammate, and is now under further development. My main contributions to the current available version include but not limited to:

#### 1. The design of the core mechanics, such as using audio as an unconventional input measure, and AI enemy behaviors, etc.

#### 2. Built a program module that converts audio input to multiple levels of controls, which is also friendly with graphics framerate

#### 3. Worked on the camera angle and physics interactions to provide a realistic experience of moving and control

#### 4. Tested successfully with multiple Android versions
